I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
Thats what people say mmm-mmm
Thats what people say mmm-mmm
I go on too many dates
But I cant make them stay
At least thats what people say mmm-mmm
Thats what people say mmm-mmm
But I keep cruising
Cant stop wont stop moving
Its like I got this music
In my mind
Saying Its gonna be alright
Cause the players gonna play play play play play
And the haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate
Baby Im just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
I shake it off I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break break break break break
And the fakers gonna fake fake fake fake fake
Baby Im just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
I shake it off I shake it off
I never miss a beat
Im lightning on my feet
And thats what they dont see mmm-mmm
Thats what they dont see mmm-mmm
Im dancing on my own
I make the moves up as I go
And thats what they dont know mmm-mmm
Thats what they dont know mmm-mmm
But I keep cruising
Cant stop wont stop grooving
Its like I got this music
In my mind
Saying Its gonna be alright
Cause the players gonna play play play play play
And the haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate
Baby Im just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
I shake it off I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break break break break break
And the fakers gonna fake fake fake fake fake
Baby Im just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
