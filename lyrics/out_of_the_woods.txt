Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet
Good
Are we out of the woods
Looking at it now
Last December
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldnt quite forget
When we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying flying flying
And I remember thinkin
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet
Good
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet
Good
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started cryin baby I did too
But when the sun came up I was lookin at you
Remember when we couldnt take the heat
I walked out and said Im settin you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
And when the sun came up you were lookin at me
You were lookin at me
You were lookin at me
I remember oh I remember
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet
Good
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet
Good
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet
Good
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet
Good
